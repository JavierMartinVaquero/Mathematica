Simulations of increasing complexity

2 Level System 
Meant to depict the coherent laser-matter interaction between two levels within an atom, the conditions necessary for simple Coherent Population Return(CPR) as well as for total excitation to the second level, no excitation at all or anything in between in a controlled fashion.

3 Level System 
As in the previous simulation, our objective is to control de population of different levels through coherent laser-matter interaction For this case more conditions must be met for maximum coherence between levels 1 and 3 while the previous simulation of a 2 level system can be reproduced as well within this simulation given the correct initial conditions, values of Rabi frequencies(Capital Omegas), pulse durations(tau)
